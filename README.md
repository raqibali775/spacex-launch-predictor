# 🚀 SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction Platform

An intelligent dashboard that analyzes and predicts the success of SpaceX rocket launches using real-time data, machine learning, and interactive visualizations.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of the *SMIT Hackathon 2025* to demonstrate real-world application of data science and machine learning in aerospace technology. It pulls historical data from the official SpaceX API, performs exploratory analysis, and predicts future launch outcomes based on input features like payload.

Built using *Python*, this platform combines data analysis, ML prediction, interactive filtering, and mapping — all in a single clean Streamlit dashboard.
